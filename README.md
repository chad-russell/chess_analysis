## Downloading

You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/Nf5/Nf5/releases) for your operating system or build it yourself (see the last section of this README).

## Adding Annotations

- To highlight squares on the chess board, simply click on them while holding down the ALT key (for green highlight), or the ALT+SHIFT keys (for red highlight).

- To add arrows, simply click and drag from any square to any other square, again while holding down the ALT key (for green arrow), or the ALT+SHIFT keys (for red arrow).
