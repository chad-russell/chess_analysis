#FUTURE
- resize board on window resize
- 'splitter view' to resize board manually
- play computer top move
- play computer top move on timer

- better spread on evaluation colors
- keep track of evaluation depth, only overwrite if depth is greater than current depth
- arrows with best move (??)
- infer ECO from opening moves
- sound
- close and reopen should save all current game state
- undo/redo
